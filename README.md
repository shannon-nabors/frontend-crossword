# CrossPost

CrossPost is an easy way for amateur crossword constructors to share their creations with other puzzle fans.  I designed this app for people who have puzzles they've already created, but need a simple way to format and host them.  The puzzles are also solveable through the site.

## As a constructor, I can:
- Create an account/username so my puzzles are associated with me.
- Choose from a set of standard grid sizes (5x5, 7x7, 15x15, 17x17, 19x19, 21x21 and 23x23) when entering a created puzzle.
- Easily choose which squares to shade by clicking in the created grid.
- Enter a title and clues for the puzzle.
- Enter the correct answers for the puzzle by typing directly into the grid.
- Post created puzzles so that they're accessible/solvable by other users.
- View (but not solve) puzzles I've created on my profile page.
- See stats (number of favorites, average solve times) for my created puzzles.

## As a solver, I can:
- Choose a puzzle to solve from an index of puzzles I haven't solved yet.
- Time myself (and pause/resume my game) as I solve.
- Solve a puzzle by typing directly into the grid.
- Interact with the grid through clicks/keystrokes as I solve (toggle the direction I'm typing by clicking the selected square, tab to the next word, backspace)
- Favorite/unfavorite a puzzle and see how many favorites a puzzle has.
- Review puzzles I've already solved and see how my average time compares to others.
